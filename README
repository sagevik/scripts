Collection of scripts
======================
A collection of scripts I currently use on my Linux setup with dwm.
Run ./install.sh to symlink all scripts to the /usr/local/bin folder
Use at your own risk..

- archupdate      : Update the system. Takes a snapshot with timeshift before updating. 
                    Can be run with the -b flag to check for updates hourly in the background, 
                    and --stop flag to stop the background running script.
